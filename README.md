My App consist of three brushes (Circle, Square, and Circle Spaltter). The Circle and Square brushes change size based 
on the velocity of finger movment.The faster you move your finger the biger the brush size.

This App can "Save" and "Clear" the image. As a special feature I added "Fill" button which is filling the page randomly anytime you 
bush the button and the filling depends on the brush you choose.

I have mostly used google search and android developer website to do this project.
